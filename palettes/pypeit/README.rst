PypeIt is a Python package for semi-automated reduction of astronomical
spectroscopic data. Its algorithms build on decades-long development of previous
data reduction pipelines by the developers. The reduction procedure - including
a complete list of the input parameters and available functionality - is
provided by our `online documentation
<https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/release/>`__.

PypeIt is designed to be used by both advanced spectroscopists with prior data
reduction expertise and astronomers with no prior experience of data reduction.
It is highly configurable and designed to be applied to any standard
slit-imaging spectrograph, including long-slit, multi-slit, as well as
cross-dispersed echelle spectra.  **The spectrographs that PypeIt can be used
with are listed** `here
<https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/release/spectrographs/spectrographs.html>`__.

Also note that `this link
<https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/release/spectrographs/spectrographs.html#instrument-specific-details>`__
contains some useful information about reducing data
with certain instruments that you might also find helpful.

In addition to our primary code base, we maintain an extensive `development
suite <https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt-development-suite>`__ primarily used to
perform multiple layers of code testing, from basic unit tests to full
end-to-end tests of all our command-line scripts.  **If you are new to PypeIt,
you are encouraged to pull example data from the DevSuite for your instrument
when learning how to use the software.**
